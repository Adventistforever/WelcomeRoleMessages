This is a sample message - You may use this file for reference. Make each role's custom messages are stored in this same /data directory with the corect filename

The file name must be `role_name-role-id.txt` - as the name of this file illustrates. (without backticks)

**Quick reference**:
The markdown syntax supported by Discord applies to this txt content as well since it's rendered by discord before being sent to the channel.
Embed body text may include links (similar to Reddit)

Italics - * *  | This is a *sample* sentence ("sample" would be italicized)
Bold -  ** **  | This is a **sample** sentence ("sample" would be bold)
Strikethrough - ~~ ~~ | This is a ~~sample~~ sentence ("sample" would have a strike through it's middle)
Links - [The disply link text](https://some-link-to-somewhere.com) | [The display link text] would appear as a clickable link directed to https://some-link-to-somewhere.com


**Emojis**:

Native supported emojies can be added by using the :emoji_name: syntax | :thumbsup: would show the thumbsup emoji
Custom guild emojies can also be used with the <:emoji_name:emoji_id> syntax | Find it easily by sending the emoji to a channel, but placing a \ in front of the icon before sending.  The resulting message can be copy/pasted into this txt file
Custom guild animated emojies can also be used with the <a:emoji_name:emoji_id> syntax | Find it easily using the same method for custom guild emojies
