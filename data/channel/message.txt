This is a sample message.  DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS FILE

**Quick reference**:
The markdown syntax supported by Discord applies to this txt content as well since it's rendered by discord before being sent to the channel.
Embed body text may include links (similar to Reddit)

Italics - * *  | This is a *sample* sentence ("sample" would be italicized)
Bold -  ** **  | This is a **sample** sentence ("sample" would be bold)
Strikethrough - ~~ ~~ | This is a ~~sample~~ sentence ("sample" would have a strike through it's middle)
Links - [The disply link text](https://some-link-to-somewhere.com) | [The display link text] would appear as a clickable link directed to https://some-link-to-somewhere.com


**Emojis**:

Native supported emojies can be added by using the :emoji_name: syntax | :thumbsup: would show the thumbsup emoji
Custom guild emojies can also be used with the <:emoji_name:emoji_id> syntax | Find it easily by sending the emoji to a channel, but placing a \ in front of the icon before sending.  The resulting message can be copy/pasted into this txt file
Custom guild animated emojies can also be used with the <a:emoji_name:emoji_id> syntax | Find it easily using the same method for custom guild emojies

To mention a member in your channel message, simply place `{member}` (no backticks) anywhere you wish to mention that user.
